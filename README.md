- ⚡ **Fun fact:** Thomas Edison, the inventor of the light bulb, made 1,000 unsuccessful attempts before he developed a successful prototype? When asked about it, Edison reportedly said, “I didn’t fail 1,000 times. The light bulb was an invention with 1,000 steps.” This highlights the power of perseverance (will) and the importance of learning from each attempt.
